# ReproductiveInteractions_workshop

Workshop on using hierarchical joint models to study reproductive interactions in plant communities

This repository includes the data and R code showing the methods for studying pollinator-mediated reproductive interactions among coflowering species as part of the "Workshop on HMSC models for pollination biologists" at the Ecoflor meeting (Leon, Spain, 5th-7th February 2025).

The 'plot_level' folder contains analyses of conspecific and heterospecific effects (flower abundance) on fruits produced by three food-deceptive co-occurring orchid species on Oland (Sweden) by Garcia et al (in prep.)

The 'individual_level' folder contains analyses of individual level fitness of the same three food-deceptive coflowering orchids to conduct phenotypic selection analyses on multiple species.
